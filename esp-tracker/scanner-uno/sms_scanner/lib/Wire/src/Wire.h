// LOCAL OVERRIDE of the framework's Wire library — only change from
// upstream is BUFFER_LENGTH 32->16 below. This exists because, unlike
// twi.h's TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH (which IS guarded by #ifndef and overridable
// via a plain build_flag), this constant is a bare #define with no guard,
// so a command-line -D would just get silently overridden by this same
// line when the header is processed. Copying the whole library into
// project-local lib/ is PlatformIO's supported way to override a
// framework library's source; the Library Dependency Finder prioritizes
// project lib/ over framework-bundled libraries.
//
// 16 bytes is safe for this project: nothing here ever sends/receives
// more than a handful of bytes in one I2C transaction (LCD commands are
// 1-4 bytes each). Saves 32 bytes of RAM (TwoWire's own rxBuffer +
// txBuffer) on top of the 48 bytes TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH already saves via
// platformio.ini's build_flags — see scanner-uno/PLAN.md-adjacent RAM
// notes in config.h for why every byte here has been worth accounting for.
